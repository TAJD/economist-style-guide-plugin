# Abbreviations and Acronyms Guidelines

Use abbreviations to aid readability, not to show off knowledge. Every abbreviation should be clear to your audience.

## General Principles

### Spell Out on First Mention
Most abbreviations should be spelled out on first use, with the abbreviation in parentheses:
- "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said..."
- "Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2%"

### When to Skip the Spell-Out
Some abbreviations are better known than their full forms. Don't spell out:
- Common units: kg, km, mph
- Well-known organisations: BBC, FBI, NASA, UN
- Technical terms in specialist publications where readers know them

### Test for Familiarity
Ask: Would my reader recognise this abbreviation without explanation?
- General audience: Fewer abbreviations, more spell-outs
- Specialist audience: Common field abbreviations need no explanation

## Acronyms and Initialisms

### Acronyms (Pronounced as Words)
Capitalise, no full stops:
- NATO (not N.A.T.O.)
- UNESCO
- OPEC
- Radar, scuba, laser (so common they're now lowercase)

### Initialisms (Pronounced Letter by Letter)
Capitalise, no full stops:
- FBI, CIA, BBC, UN
- GDP, IMF, EU
- CEO, CFO

### Mixed Forms
Some abbreviations have both:
- FAQ (pronounced "fack" or "F-A-Q")
- SQL (pronounced "sequel" or "S-Q-L")

Use the most common pronunciation for your audience.

## Formatting Rules

### No Full Stops
Do not use full stops in abbreviations:

| Write | Not |
|-------|-----|
| GDP | G.D.P. |
| Mr | Mr. |
| Dr | Dr. |
| St | St. (for Saint) |
| kg | kg. |
| etc | etc. |
| ie | i.e. |
| eg | e.g. |

### Capitalisation
- Most abbreviations: All caps (GDP, IMF, EU)
- Lower case for units: kg, km, mb
- Mixed case for some: kWh, PhD

### Articles
Use "a" or "an" based on pronunciation:
- "An FBI agent" (sounds like "eff")
- "A UN resolution" (sounds like "you")
- "An IMF report" (sounds like "eye")

## Latin Abbreviations

### Common Latin Terms

| Abbreviation | Meaning | Usage |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| ie | that is | Clarifies or restates: "The largest market, ie America" |
| eg | for example | Introduces examples: "Major cities, eg London and Paris" |
| etc | and so forth | Ends incomplete lists: "taxes, spending, etc" |
| cf | compare | Cross-reference: "cf the earlier report" |
| NB | note well | Draws attention: "NB: deadline is Friday" |
| viz | namely | Lists specifics: "Two countries, viz France and Germany" |
| vs | versus | Opposition: "Smith vs Jones" |

### Usage Notes
- **ie vs eg**: "ie" means "that is" (restates the same thing differently); "eg" means "for example" (gives instances)
- **Avoid overuse**: Latin abbreviations can seem academic or pretentious. Use sparingly.
- **Punctuation**: No commas after ie or eg unless your style guide requires them

### When to Avoid
Consider replacing Latin abbreviations with plain English:
- "eg" → "such as" or "for example"
- "ie" → "that is" or "in other words"
- "etc" → "and so on" or "among others"

## Plurals of Abbreviations

### Standard Plurals
Add lowercase "s", no apostrophe:
- "MPs" (not "MP's")
- "CEOs" (not "CEO's")
- "GDPs of various countries"
- "The 1990s" (not "1990's")

### Exceptions
Some abbreviations don't take plurals:
- Units of measurement: "5 kg" not "5 kgs"
- "Pp" for pages (or just "pages 1-10")

## Abbreviations to Avoid

### Overused Abbreviations
Some abbreviations appear so often they lose meaning:

| Tired | Alternative |
|-------|-------------|
| ASAP | Soon, by Friday, urgently |
| TBD | Undecided, to be confirmed |
| TBC | To be confirmed |
| FYI | [Often unnecessary—just give the information] |

### Jargon Abbreviations
Avoid abbreviations that only insiders know:
- Spell out industry-specific terms for general audiences
- Consider whether the abbreviation helps or hinders clarity

## Titles and Honorifics

### Standard Forms
No full stops:
- Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, Prof
- Jr, Sr

### When to Use
- First mention: Full name with title if relevant: "Dr Jane Smith"
- Subsequently: Surname only: "Smith said..."
- In quotes: Use the title the person prefers

## Company and Organisation Names

### Follow Their Style
Use the organisation's preferred form:
- eBay, iPhone, PayPal (respect capitalisation)
- IBM, not I.B.M.

### At Sentence Start
Capitalise if needed for clarity:
- "EBay announced..." (or rewrite to avoid)
- "The company eBay announced..."

## Geographic Abbreviations

### Countries
Spell out in running text:
- "The United States" or "America", not "the US" (though US is acceptable as adjective: "US policy")
- "The United Kingdom" or "Britain", not "the UK"

In tables, charts, and addresses, abbreviations are acceptable:
- US, UK, EU, UAE

### States and Regions
For US states:
- Spell out in text: "California passed a law"
- Abbreviate in addresses and data: CA, NY, TX

## Technical Contexts

### Science and Technology
Define on first use unless writing for specialists:
- "Artificial intelligence (AI)"
- "Application programming interface (API)"

### Financial Terms
Common financial abbreviations:
- P/E (price-to-earnings ratio)
- ROI (return on investment)
- IPO (initial public offering)
- M&A (mergers and acquisitions)
