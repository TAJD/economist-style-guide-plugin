# Tone and Voice Guidelines

The Economist's voice is authoritative but not arrogant, serious but not dull, confident but not dogmatic. Aim for clarity and directness without being preachy or casual.

## The Right Register

### Authoritative, Not Arrogant
State facts and analysis with confidence. Avoid hedging unnecessarily, but don't overstate your case.

**Good**: "The policy has failed"
**Too timid**: "It could perhaps be argued that the policy may have underperformed"
**Too arrogant**: "Only a fool would deny the policy has failed"

### Serious, Not Dull
Write about serious topics in an engaging way. Use vivid examples and concrete details.

**Dull**: "Economic output declined in the third quarter"
**Engaging**: "The economy shrank for the first time in three years, catching forecasters off guard"

### Confident, Not Dogmatic
Present your analysis clearly, but acknowledge uncertainty and opposing views where they exist.

**Good**: "The evidence suggests..."
**Dogmatic**: "There can be no doubt that..."
**Too weak**: "Some people might possibly think..."

## What to Avoid

### Being Too Casual
Avoid slang, colloquialisms, and overly informal language.

| Too Casual | Better |
|------------|--------|
| "The economy tanked" | "The economy contracted sharply" |
| "Politicians got into a spat" | "Politicians clashed" |
| "It's a big deal" | "It matters greatly" |
| "Kind of disappointing" | "Disappointing" |
| "Basically, the problem is..." | "The problem is..." |

### Being Too Chatty
Avoid addressing the reader directly too often, or using conversational fillers.

| Too Chatty | Better |
|------------|--------|
| "You might think that..." | "It might seem that..." |
| "Well, it turns out..." | "In fact..." |
| "Now, here's the thing..." | [Delete and get to the point] |
| "So, what does this mean?" | "The implications are..." |

### Being Preachy or Didactic
Do not lecture the reader. Present analysis, not moral instruction.

| Preachy | Neutral |
|---------|---------|
| "Governments must act now" | "The case for government action is strong" |
| "This cannot be allowed to continue" | "This is unsustainable" |
| "We should all recognise that..." | "The evidence shows..." |
| "It is vital that people understand..." | [Just explain clearly] |

### Being Flippant
Avoid treating serious subjects too lightly.

| Flippant | Appropriate |
|----------|-------------|
| "Another day, another crisis" | "The latest crisis follows several others" |
| "Surprise, surprise" | "As expected" |
| "Good luck with that" | "The prospects are uncertain" |

## Adjectives and Adverbs

### Use Restraint
Strong writing relies on nouns and verbs, not adjectives and adverbs. Most modifiers can be cut.

**Overwritten**: "The absolutely devastating economic crisis brutally crushed the already struggling middle class"

**Better**: "The economic crisis hurt the middle class"

### Avoid Intensifiers
Words like "very", "really", "extremely", and "incredibly" add little.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Very important" | "Crucial" or "Important" |
| "Really significant" | "Significant" |
| "Extremely difficult" | "Difficult" |
| "Incredibly successful" | "Successful" |

### Avoid Evaluative Adjectives
Let readers draw their own conclusions from the facts.

| Evaluative | Neutral |
|------------|---------|
| "An impressive 10% growth" | "Growth of 10%" |
| "A disappointing result" | "The result: X" |
| "An alarming trend" | "A trend that concerns policymakers" |
| "A brilliant strategy" | "A strategy that achieved X" |

### When Adjectives Work
Adjectives earn their place when they:
- Add essential information: "a five-year plan", "a bilateral agreement"
- Make meaningful distinctions: "a small firm" vs "a large firm"
- Are specific and factual: "a 20% increase", "a Chinese company"

## Irony and Humour

### Use Sparingly
The Economist can be wry, but humour should not undermine credibility.

**Acceptable**: Dry observations, wordplay in headlines, subtle irony
**Not acceptable**: Sarcasm, mockery, jokes that trivialise serious issues

### Irony Risks
- Irony can be misread, especially across cultures
- It can seem smug or superior
- Overuse becomes tiresome

### Scare Quotes
Use quotation marks for irony sparingly:
- "The 'expert' opinion proved wrong"
- "Their 'solution' created new problems"

Too many scare quotes suggest the writer is sneering at everything.

## Balance and Fairness

### Present Opposing Views
When covering contested issues, represent different perspectives fairly.

**Good practice**:
- "Critics argue... Supporters counter..."
- "The government says... Opposition groups disagree..."
- Give specific claims, not just "some people say"

### Avoid Loaded Language
Choose neutral terms when describing disputed matters.

| Loaded | Neutral |
|--------|---------|
| "The regime" (unless describing a specific type of government) | "The government" |
| "So-called experts" | "Experts" (or critique specifically) |
| "Claimed" (implies doubt) | "Said" |
| "Admitted" (implies wrongdoing) | "Said" or "acknowledged" |

### Attribution Matters
"Said" is neutral. Other verbs carry connotations:

| Verb | Connotation |
|------|-------------|
| Said | Neutral |
| Claimed | Implies doubt |
| Admitted | Implies wrongdoing |
| Revealed | Implies something hidden |
| Insisted | Implies stubbornness |
| Acknowledged | Implies reluctance |

Use these deliberately, not carelessly.

## Pronouns and Point of View

### Avoid First Person
The Economist traditionally avoids "I" and uses "we" sparingly, typically only in editorials representing the publication's view.

**Avoid**: "I think...", "I believe..."
**Better**: "The evidence suggests...", "The data show..."

### Use "We" with Care
"We" can mean:
- The publication (acceptable in editorials)
- A country or group (be clear about who)
- The reader and writer together (occasionally)

**Avoid**: Vague "we" that's unclear about who is meant.

### Second Person
Avoid addressing the reader as "you" except in specific contexts (guides, advice columns).

## Confidence Without Certainty

### State Your Case
Don't hedge excessively. If the evidence supports a conclusion, state it.

**Too hesitant**: "It might perhaps be suggested that the policy could potentially have some negative effects"

**Better**: "The policy has failed"

### Acknowledge Limits
But don't overclaim. Use appropriate qualifiers when warranted:
- "The evidence suggests..."
- "On balance..."
- "The most likely explanation..."

### When to Hedge
Hedge when:
- The evidence is genuinely uncertain
- You're making a prediction
- You're characterising others' views

Don't hedge when:
- The facts are clear
- You're stating established knowledge
- You've already made your argument
