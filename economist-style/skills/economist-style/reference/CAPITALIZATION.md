# Capitalisation Guidelines

Capitalise sparingly. Overuse of capitals looks pompous and clutters the page. When in doubt, use lower case.

## General Principle

Capitalise proper nouns (specific names). Use lower case for common nouns (general categories).

**Capitalise**: The Treasury, President Biden, the Sahara
**Lower case**: the treasury department, the president, the desert

## Job Titles

### With Names
Capitalise titles used directly before a name:
- "President Biden announced..."
- "Chancellor Scholz said..."
- "Professor Smith argued..."

### Without Names
Use lower case for titles used generically or after a name:
- "The president announced..." (referring to Biden)
- "Joe Biden, the president, said..."
- "The chancellor of Germany..."
- "Angela Merkel, who was then chancellor..."

### Common Titles

### Company Titles

## Government and Institutions

### Specific Institutions

- "The House of Commons"

Use lower case when referring to an institution in shortened form:
- "The Commons voted..." (but "the house voted" if meaning is clear)
- "The court ruled..." (after first mention of Supreme Court)
- "The Fed raised rates..." (acceptable as widely understood)
- "The commission proposed..."

### Generic References
Lower case for generic institutional references:
- "In parliament..."
- "Central banks around the world..."
- "The government announced..." (generic)

### Specific vs Generic
