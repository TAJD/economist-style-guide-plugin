# Clarity Guidelines

## Passive Voice

The Economist strongly prefers active voice. Passive voice obscures who is responsible for actions.

### Common Passive Patterns to Avoid

- "was/were [verb]ed" → Active alternative
- "has/have been [verb]ed" → Active alternative
- "is/are being [verb]ed" → Active alternative

### Examples

**Weak (Passive)**:
- "The report was published by the committee"
- "Mistakes were made"
- "It is believed that rates will rise"

**Strong (Active)**:
- "The committee published the report"
- "We made mistakes" or "The team made mistakes"
- "Economists believe rates will rise"

### When Passive Voice is Acceptable

- When the actor is unknown: "The building was constructed in 1843"
- When the object is more important: "The president was assassinated"
- Scientific writing when focusing on results: "The sample was heated to 100°C"

## Jargon and Bureaucratese

Replace technical jargon and business-speak with plain English.

### Common Offenders

| Jargon | Plain English |
|--------|---------------|
| utilise | use |
| optimise | improve |
| facilitate | help, enable |
| implement | introduce, start |
| leverage | use, exploit |
| synergy | cooperation |
| stakeholder | people affected, investors |
| going forward | from now on, in future |
| action (as verb) | do, carry out |
| learnings | lessons |

## Unnecessary Complexity

Choose short, common words over long, uncommon ones.

### Word Replacements

| Complex | Simple |
|---------|--------|
| approximately | about |
| commence | begin, start |
| endeavour | try |
| purchase | buy |
| terminate | end |
| in the event that | if |
| prior to | before |
| subsequent to | after |
| in order to | to |
| with regard to | about |

## Hedge Words That Weaken Writing

The Economist values confident, direct statements. Remove unnecessary hedging.

### Common Hedges to Avoid

- "It could be argued that..."
- "To some extent..."
- "It might be said that..."
- "In a sense..."
- "Arguably..."
- "Possibly..."
- "Perhaps..."

### When Hedging is Appropriate

- Genuine uncertainty about facts
- Academic or scientific caution
- Diplomatic language when discussing controversial topics

### Better Alternatives

Instead of: "It could be argued that inflation is rising"
Write: "Inflation is rising" (if it's a fact)
Or: "Some economists argue inflation is rising" (if it's a viewpoint)

## Sentence Length

- Aim for average sentence length of 15-20 words
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Break up sentences over 25 words unless there's a good reason
- One idea per sentence

## Paragraph Structure

- Start with the main point (topic sentence)
- Supporting evidence follows
- Each paragraph should advance the argument
- Typical paragraph: 3-5 sentences
