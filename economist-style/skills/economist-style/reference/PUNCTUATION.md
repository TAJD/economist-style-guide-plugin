# Punctuation Guidelines

Punctuation exists to clarify meaning. Use it sparingly but precisely. Every mark should serve a purpose.

## Commas

### Serial (Oxford) Comma

The Economist does **not** use the serial comma except when needed for clarity.

**Standard usage**:
- "France, Germany and Italy" (no comma before "and")
- "The report covered tax, spending and regulation"

**Use when needed for clarity**:
- "The options were ham and eggs, toast, and cereal" (prevents confusion)
- "I dedicate this to my parents, Ayn Rand and God" needs comma: "my parents, Ayn Rand, and God"

### Restrictive vs Non-Restrictive Clauses

**Restrictive** (no commas) - essential information:
- "The countries that signed the treaty must comply"
- "Workers who lack skills struggle to find jobs"

**Non-restrictive** (commas) - additional information:
- "China, which signed the treaty, must comply"
- "The workers, who had been there for years, were laid off"

### Common Comma Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| "The company, said it would expand" | "The company said it would expand" |
| "He argued that, the policy failed" | "He argued that the policy failed" |
| "However the results were clear" | "However, the results were clear" |

### Comma Splices

Never join two independent clauses with just a comma.

**Wrong**: "The economy grew, inflation remained low"

**Correct options**:
- "The economy grew; inflation remained low"
- "The economy grew, and inflation remained low"
- "The economy grew. Inflation remained low"

## Semicolons

Use semicolons to:

### Link Related Independent Clauses
- "The economy is growing; unemployment is falling"
- "Interest rates rose; the market corrected"

### Separate Complex List Items
When list items contain commas, use semicolons between them:
- "The delegation included Smith, the chairman; Jones, the treasurer; and Brown, the secretary"

### Before Conjunctive Adverbs
- "Growth slowed; however, employment held steady"
- "The policy failed; therefore, it was abandoned"

**Common conjunctive adverbs**: however, therefore, moreover, nevertheless, consequently, furthermore, otherwise

## Colons

### Introduce Lists or Explanations
- "Three factors drove growth: exports, investment and consumption"
- "The conclusion was clear: reform had failed"

### After Complete Sentences Only
The text before a colon must be a complete sentence.

**Wrong**: "The factors were: exports and investment"

**Correct**: "The factors were exports and investment" or "Two factors drove growth: exports and investment"

### Capitalisation After Colons
Do not capitalise after a colon unless what follows is a complete sentence or a proper noun.
- "The message was clear: austerity would continue"
- "One truth emerged: Markets do not wait"

## Apostrophes

### Possessives

**Singular nouns**: Add 's
- "The company's profits"
- "James's book" (not "James' book")

**Plural nouns ending in s**: Add apostrophe only
- "The companies' profits"
- "The workers' demands"

**Irregular plurals**: Add 's
- "The children's school"
- "The people's choice"

### Special Cases

| Case | Example |
|------|---------|
| Joint possession | "Smith and Jones's firm" (one firm) |
| Separate possession | "Smith's and Jones's firms" (two firms) |
| Compound nouns | "The attorney-general's opinion" |
| Time expressions | "A week's notice", "Two years' experience" |

### Contractions
Apostrophes replace omitted letters:
- "It's" = "It is" or "It has"
- "Don't" = "Do not"
- "The '90s" = "The 1990s"

**Warning**: "Its" (possessive) has no apostrophe. "It's" always means "it is" or "it has".

## Quotation Marks

### The Economist Style

The Economist uses a hybrid approach:
- **Double quotes** for primary quotations: "This is a quote"
- **Single quotes** for quotes within quotes: "When I say 'immediately', I mean before April"
- **Logical punctuation**: Punctuation goes outside quotes unless part of the original quotation

This combines double quotes (American convention) with logical punctuation (British convention).

### Standard British vs American Style

**Standard British**:
- Single quotes for quotations: 'This is a quote'
- Double quotes for quotes within quotes: 'He said "yes" to that'
- Punctuation outside quotes unless part of the quotation

**Standard American**:
- Double quotes for quotations: "This is a quote"
- Single quotes for quotes within quotes: "He said 'yes' to that"
- Punctuation inside quotes

### Punctuation Placement

**Inside quotes** (when part of the original):
- She asked, 'Where is it?'
- He shouted, 'Stop!'

**Outside quotes** (when not part of the original):
- What did she mean by 'reform'?
- The report mentioned 'significant progress'.

### Scare Quotes
Use sparingly to indicate irony or distance:
- The 'experts' failed to predict the crisis
- Their 'solution' made things worse

Avoid overuse; it becomes tiresome.

## Hyphens

### Compound Modifiers Before Nouns
Hyphenate compound adjectives before a noun:
- "A well-known economist" but "The economist is well known"
- "A long-term strategy" but "The strategy is long term"
- "High-quality research" but "Research of high quality"

### Prefixes
Generally do not hyphenate prefixes:

| Write | Not |
|-------|-----|
| Prewar | Pre-war |
| Postwar | Post-war |
| Cooperate | Co-operate |
| Coordinate | Co-ordinate |
| Microeconomics | Micro-economics |
| Macroeconomic | Macro-economic |

**Exceptions** (hyphenate for clarity):
- "Re-cover" (cover again) vs "Recover" (get back)
- "Re-sign" (sign again) vs "Resign" (quit)
- Before capitals: "Anti-American", "Pro-European"
- Double vowels when unclear: "Co-opt", "Re-elect"

### Numbers
- Twenty-one to ninety-nine
- Two-thirds, three-quarters
- A five-year plan, a ten-point lead

### Common Hyphenated Terms

| Hyphenated | Not Hyphenated |
|------------|----------------|
| Self-made | Selfless |
| Cross-border | Crossfire |
| Half-hearted | Halfway |
| Full-time (adj) | Full time (noun) |
| Part-time (adj) | Part time (noun) |

## Dashes

### En Dash (–)
Use for ranges and connections:
- "Pages 10–15"
- "The London–Paris train"
- "The 2020–21 fiscal year"
- "The Conservative–Liberal coalition"

### Em Dash (—)
Use sparingly for emphasis or interruption:
- "The result—surprising to many—was a landslide"
- "Three factors mattered: growth, inflation and—most critically—employment"

**Prefer parentheses or commas** in most cases. Em dashes should be rare.

**No spaces** around em dashes.

## Parentheses and Brackets

### Parentheses ()
For supplementary information:
- "The GDP (gross domestic product) grew by 3%"
- "Output rose (see chart)"

Keep parenthetical content brief. If it's essential, integrate it into the sentence.

### Square Brackets []
For insertions in quotations:
- "He said the policy [on immigration] was flawed"
- "The report noted that '[t]he results were clear'"

## Ellipses

Use three dots (...) to indicate omission:
- "The report stated that growth... would continue"

**Avoid** ellipses for trailing off or creating suspense. This is not creative writing.

## Full Stops (Periods)

### Abbreviations
No full stops in abbreviations:
- GDP, IMF, UN, EU, NATO
- Mr, Mrs, Dr, St
- kg, km, mph

### Sentences
One space after a full stop, not two.

## Question and Exclamation Marks

### Questions
Use only for genuine questions:
- "Will interest rates rise?"

**Avoid** rhetorical questions in serious analysis. They can seem glib.

### Exclamation Marks
Almost never use them. They suggest the writer is shouting.

**Wrong**: "Growth surged to 5%!"

**Correct**: "Growth surged to 5%"

If the content is striking, the words should convey that—not the punctuation.
