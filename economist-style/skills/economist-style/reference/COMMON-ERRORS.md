## Gender-Neutral Language

### Avoid Generic Masculine

**Outdated**:
- ❌ The businessman should review his accounts

- ❌ Man has conquered space

**Better options**:
- Pluralise: "Businesspeople should review their accounts"
- Use "they": "Every worker must submit their timesheet"
- Reword: "Humanity has conquered space" or "Humans have reached space"

### Job Titles

| Outdated | Preferred |
|----------|-----------|
| Chairman | Chair, chairperson |
| Businessman | Business executive, business owner |

### Singular They

The singular "they" is acceptable for:
- Unknown or unspecified individuals: "Each applicant should submit their CV"

## Sensitivity and Inclusive Language

### People-First Language

Put the person before the condition:

| Less inclusive | More inclusive |
|----------------|----------------|
| The disabled | People with disabilities |
| Diabetics | People with diabetes |
| The homeless | People experiencing homelessness |
| The elderly | Older people, older adults |
| The mentally ill | People with mental health conditions |

**Exception**: Some communities prefer identity-first language (e.g., "autistic person" preferred by many autistic people). When possible, follow the preference of the group being discussed.

### Race and Ethnicity

- Capitalise racial and ethnic identities: Black, White, Asian, Latino
- Avoid using "minorities" to mean all non-white people
- Be specific when possible: "Chinese", "Nigerian", "Mexican" rather than generic "Asian", "African", "Hispanic"
- Avoid stereotypes and generalisations
- Do not mention race unless relevant to the story

### Disability

- Avoid euphemisms: "differently abled", "special needs", "handicapable"
- Use neutral terms: "uses a wheelchair" not "wheelchair-bound" or "confined to a wheelchair"
- Avoid portraying people with disabilities as inspirational merely for existing
- Do not describe medical conditions in dramatic terms: "suffering from" → "has" or "lives with"

### Mental Health

| Avoid | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Crazy, insane, nuts | [Be specific about behaviour] |
| Committed suicide | Died by suicide |
| Schizophrenic (as adjective) | "A person with schizophrenia" |
| Mentally ill (noun) | People with mental illness |

### Age

- Avoid ageist language: "spry for her age", "still sharp at 80"
- Use "older people" or "older adults" rather than "the elderly" or "the aged"
- Avoid assumptions about capability based on age
- Be precise about age when relevant rather than vague generational labels

### Sexuality and Gender Identity

- Use the terminology individuals prefer for themselves
- LGBTQ+ is a common umbrella term (note: preferences vary by region and community)
- Use appropriate pronouns (he, she, they) as indicated
- "Sexual orientation" not "sexual preference"
- "Transgender" is an adjective: "a transgender person" not "a transgender" or "transgendered"

### Economic Status

| Avoid | Use |
|-------|-----|
| The poor | People with low incomes, people in poverty |
| Underprivileged | Under-resourced |
| Third-world | Low-income countries, developing economies |
| Slum | Informal settlement |

### General Principles

1. **Precision over euphemism**: Be clear and accurate, not vague
2. **Respect preferences**: Where known, use terms people use for themselves
3. **Avoid defining people by single characteristics**: "a woman with epilepsy" not "an epileptic woman"
4. **Update your language**: Preferred terms evolve; stay current
5. **Focus on relevance**: Only mention characteristics when relevant to the story
