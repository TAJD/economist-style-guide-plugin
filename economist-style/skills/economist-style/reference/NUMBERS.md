# Numbers and Figures Guidelines

Numbers convey precision. Handle them consistently to maintain credibility and readability.

## When to Spell Out vs Use Numerals

### Spell Out
- Numbers one to nine: "three companies", "five years"
- Numbers at the start of sentences: "Twenty people attended" (or rewrite to avoid)
- Round numbers used loosely: "about a hundred", "thousands of people"
- Common expressions: "the big three automakers", "the four horsemen"

### Use Numerals
- Numbers 10 and above: "12 countries", "250 employees"
- Numbers with units: "5km", "3%", "$7m"
- Ages: "a 6-year-old child", "aged 45"
- Scores and votes: "won 3-2", "passed 52-48"
- Addresses: "10 Downing Street"
- Dates and times (see below)

### Mixed Usage in Same Sentence
When a sentence contains both small and large numbers of the same type, use numerals for all:
- "The sample included 8 small firms and 12 large ones"
- NOT: "eight small firms and 12 large ones"

## Percentages

### Format
- Use the % symbol with numerals: "5%", "10.5%"
- Spell out "per cent" in running text if desired: "five per cent"
- No space before %: "10%" not "10 %"

### Percentage Points vs Percentages
Be precise about the difference:

| Scenario | Correct | Incorrect |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Rate moves from 5% to 7% | "Rose by 2 percentage points" | "Rose by 2%" |
| Quantity increases by 40% | "Rose by 40%" | "Rose by 40 percentage points" |

**Wrong**: "Unemployment fell from 10% to 8%, a drop of 2%"
**Correct**: "Unemployment fell from 10% to 8%, a drop of 2 percentage points"

### Basis Points
In financial contexts, 100 basis points = 1 percentage point:
- "Interest rates rose by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points)"

## Fractions and Decimals

### Fractions
- Hyphenate spelled-out fractions: "two-thirds", "three-quarters"
- Use numerals for precision: "3/4" or "0.75"
- Mixed numbers: "2½" or "2.5"

### Decimals
- Use a full stop (period) as the decimal point: "3.5"
- Limit decimal places to what is meaningful: "3.7%" not "3.7142857%"
- Use leading zero: "0.5" not ".5"

## Dates and Times

### Dates

**British format** (The Economist's default):
- "1st January 2024" or "January 1st 2024"
- "1 January 2024" (also acceptable)

**American format**:
- "January 1, 2024"

### Decades and Centuries
- "The 1990s" (no apostrophe)
- "The mid-1980s"
- "The 21st century" (not "21st Century")
- "The early 2000s"

### Times
- Use the 12-hour clock in text: "3pm", "9.30am"
- No space before am/pm
- Use 24-hour clock only in technical contexts: "15:00"
- "Noon" and "midnight" rather than "12pm" and "12am"

### Spans
- "2020-24" or "2020–24" (en dash)
- "From 2020 to 2024" (not "from 2020-24")
- "Between 2020 and 2024" (not "between 2020-24")

## Currency

### Format
- Symbol before numeral: "$50", "£30", "€100"
- No space between symbol and number

### Large Amounts
Use abbreviations for readability:

| Amount | Write | Not |
|--------|-------|-----|
| $5,000,000 | $5m | $5 million |
| $5,000,000,000 | $5bn | $5 billion |
| $5,000,000,000,000 | $5trn | $5 trillion |

### Specify Currency
On first mention, clarify which dollar, pound, etc.:
- "A$50bn" (Australian dollars)
- "C$30m" (Canadian dollars)
- "HK$100m" (Hong Kong dollars)

### Exchange Rates
- "The euro traded at $1.10"
- "¥150 to the dollar"

## Large Numbers

### Thousands
- Use commas: "10,000" not "10000"
- Or write: "10,000" as "10,000"

### Millions and Billions
- Use abbreviations: "5m", "3.2bn", "1trn"
- In tables, define abbreviations in headers or footnotes

### Billions: American vs British
The Economist uses the American billion (1,000,000,000 = 10⁹), not the British billion (10¹²):
- 1 billion = 1,000 million
- 1 trillion = 1,000 billion

## Ordinals

### When to Use
- Dates: "1st January", "the 21st century"
- Rankings: "the 3rd largest economy"
- Sequences: "for the 5th consecutive year"

### Format
- Use superscript if available: 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ, 3ʳᵈ
- Or standard: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th
- Spell out for first through ninth in running text: "the third quarter"

## Ranges and Approximations

### Ranges
- Use en dash: "10–15%", "pages 5–10"
- Or spell out: "10 to 15%", "from 5 to 10"
- Never mix: NOT "from 10–15%"

### Approximations
- "About 100" or "roughly 100"
- "Some 50 companies" (implies approximately)
- Avoid false precision: "about 47%" should be "about 50%" or "nearly half"

## Units of Measurement

### Abbreviations
No full stops in unit abbreviations:
- km, kg, lb, oz, mph, kWh

### Metric vs Imperial
Consider your audience:
- International: Use metric (km, kg, °C)
- American contexts: May include imperial (miles, pounds, °F)
- Provide conversions when helpful: "100km (62 miles)"

### Spacing
- No space between number and unit: "5km", "10kg"
- Exception: "5 per cent" if spelling out

## Tables and Charts

### Consistency
- Use the same format throughout a table
- Align decimal points
- Use consistent decimal places within columns

### Headers
- Include units in column headers: "Revenue ($m)"
- Define abbreviations: "GDP, % change year on year"

### Precision
- Match precision to data quality
- Avoid implying false precision: "3.7142857%" suggests more accuracy than likely exists

## Common Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| "5,000,000 dollars" | "$5m" |
| "50 %" | "50%" |
| "between 10-20" | "between 10 and 20" or "10-20" |
| ".5" | "0.5" |
| "the 1990's" | "the 1990s" |
| "12.00pm" | "noon" |
| "a increase of 2%" (when rate moved from 5% to 7%) | "an increase of 2 percentage points" |
