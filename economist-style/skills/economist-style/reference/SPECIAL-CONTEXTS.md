# Special Contexts Guidelines

Certain contexts—quotations, foreign words, lists, and citations—require special handling to maintain clarity and consistency.

## Foreign Words and Phrases

### Italicisation
Italicise foreign words and phrases that are not commonly used in English:
- *Schadenfreude*, *coup d'état*, *Zeitgeist*
- *De facto*, *pro bono*, *sine qua non*

### When Not to Italicise
Do not italicise foreign words that have become part of English:
- Cliché, café, naive, resume (or résumé)
- Per capita, ad hoc, status quo, vice versa
- Détente, glasnost, perestroika

**Test**: If it appears in an English dictionary without being marked as foreign, don't italicise.

### Common Foreign Terms

| Keep italicised | Now English (don't italicise) |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| *Realpolitik* | Ad hoc |
| *Doppelgänger* | Per capita |
| *Savoir-faire* | Entrepreneur |
| *Weltanschauung* | Regime |
| *In extremis* | Status quo |
| *Fait accompli* | Vice versa |

### Translation
Provide translation or explanation when needed:
- "The German concept of *Mittelstand* (medium-sized family businesses)"
- "A sense of *Weltschmerz*, or world-weariness"

### Accents
Preserve accents on foreign words:
- Café, résumé, naïve, façade
- But not on fully anglicised words: elite, regime, role

## Quotations

### Direct Quotes
Use quotation marks for direct speech or text:
- He said, 'The policy has failed'
- The report stated that 'growth will slow'

### Quote Accuracy
- Never alter quotes without indicating changes
- Use [brackets] for insertions
- Use ... for omissions
- Correct obvious typos silently only if meaning is clear

### Attribution

**Position**: Attribution can come before, during, or after the quote:
- Smith said, 'The economy is strong'
- 'The economy is strong,' Smith said
- 'The economy,' Smith said, 'is strong'

**Verbs**: Use neutral verbs:
- "Said" is almost always best
- "Asked" for questions
- "Wrote" for written sources

**Avoid loaded verbs** (unless the connotation is intended):
- Claimed, admitted, conceded, insisted

### Long Quotations
For quotes longer than a few sentences:
- Consider using a block quote (indented, no quotation marks)
- Or break up with attribution and paraphrase
- Always ask: Is the full quote necessary?

### Partial Quotes
When quoting a phrase within your sentence:
- "The minister called it a 'historic moment' for reform"
- Ensure the quote integrates grammatically

### Quotes Within Quotes
Use single quotes within double (American) or double within single (British):
- British: 'He said "yes" to that'
- American: "He said 'yes' to that"

## Lists

### When to Use Lists
Lists work well for:
- Multiple parallel items
- Step-by-step instructions
- Options or alternatives
- Items that would be awkward in prose

### Numbered vs Bulleted

**Numbered lists** for:
- Sequential steps (first, then, finally)
- Ranked items (most to least important)
- Items you'll reference by number

**Bulleted lists** for:
- Items of equal importance
- Non-sequential items
- Options without ranking

### List Formatting

**Punctuation**: Be consistent within a list.

Option 1 (sentence fragments, no punctuation):
- Lower case
- No full stops
- Short phrases

Option 2 (complete sentences):
- Start with capitals.
- End with full stops.
- Write complete sentences.

**Parallel structure**: All items should have the same grammatical form.

**Wrong**:
- Reviewing the data
- We analysed the results
- To draw conclusions

**Correct**:
- Review the data
- Analyse the results
- Draw conclusions

### Lead-ins
The text introducing a list should end with a colon if the list completes the sentence:
- "Three factors matter:" [list follows]

No colon if the lead-in is a complete sentence:
- "Consider these factors." [list follows]

## Tables and Figures

### Table Design
- Clear, descriptive headers
- Consistent formatting within columns
- Units in headers, not in cells: "Revenue ($m)" not "$100m" in each cell
- Align numbers on decimal points

### Captions
Tables and figures need captions that:
- Describe what is shown
- Include source information
- Explain abbreviations or units

**Example**:
"Table 1: GDP growth by region, 2015–24 (% change year on year). Source: World Bank"

### Referencing
Refer to tables and figures by number:
- "As shown in Table 1..."
- "See Figure 3 for the trend"
- Not "the table below" (position may change)

### Data Presentation
- Round to appropriate precision
- Use consistent decimal places within a column
- Include totals where helpful
- Note any missing data

## Citations and References

### In-Text Citations
For academic or research writing:
- Author-date: (Smith, 2024) or Smith (2024)
- Numbered: [1] or superscript¹

### Attribution in Journalism
For news writing, attribution is woven into text:
- "According to a study by Harvard economists..."
- "Research published in Nature suggests..."
- "Data from the World Bank show..."

### Source Credibility
Be specific about sources:

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Studies show" | "A 2024 study by MIT found" |
| "Experts say" | "Janet Yellen, former Fed chair, said" |
| "Critics argue" | "The IMF warned that" |

### Hyperlinks
In digital text:
- Link meaningful phrases, not "click here"
- "A recent [World Bank report] found..."
- Links should go to primary sources when possible

## Footnotes and Endnotes

### When to Use
Footnotes work for:
- Additional context that would interrupt flow
- Source citations
- Caveats or qualifications
- Definitions

### Keep Them Brief
Long footnotes disrupt reading. If the information is important, put it in the main text.

### Numbering
- Number sequentially through the document
- Use superscript numbers in text
- Place the number after punctuation: "... in 2024."¹

## Captions and Labels

### Image Captions
Should include:
- What the image shows
- When and where (if relevant)
- Credit/source

**Example**: "Protesters in Hong Kong, June 2019. Reuters"

### Chart Labels
- Clear axis titles
- Units specified
- Legend if multiple series
- Source line

## Dialogue and Interviews

### Formatting Interviews
**Q&A format**:
- **Q**: What is your view?
- **A**: I believe...

**Narrative format**:
- Weave quotes into prose
- "Asked about growth, she replied that..."

### Cleaning Up Speech
Spoken language is messier than written. It's acceptable to:
- Remove verbal fillers (um, uh, you know)
- Fix minor grammatical errors
- Condense for clarity

But never:
- Change the meaning
- Improve the substance of what was said
- Make quotes sound more impressive

## Checklist

- [ ] Are quotations accurate and properly attributed?
- [ ] Do lists have parallel structure?
- [ ] Are tables clearly labelled with sources?
