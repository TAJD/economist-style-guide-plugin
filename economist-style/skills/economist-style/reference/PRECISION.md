# Precision Guidelines

## Weasel Words

Weasel words are vague terms that lack specificity. They appear to make claims without committing to verifiable statements.

### Common Weasel Words

**Vague Quantifiers**:
- many → how many? (give a number or percentage)
- few → how many exactly?
- several → specify the number
- numerous → quantify
- various → which ones specifically?
- some → how many?

**Vague Qualifiers**:
- significant → how significant? (percentage, magnitude)
- substantial → quantify the amount
- considerable → specify
- notable → in what way?
- remarkable → what makes it remarkable?

**Weasel Claims**:
- "Studies show..." → Which studies? Cite them
- "Experts say..." → Which experts? Name them
- "It is widely believed..." → By whom? Evidence?
- "Research indicates..." → What research? Reference it
- "Many people think..." → What proportion? Evidence?

### Examples with Fixes

**Weak**: "Many companies are adopting remote work"
**Strong**: "43% of FTSE 100 companies now offer remote work options" (2024 survey)

**Weak**: "The project saw significant delays"
**Strong**: "The project finished four months late"

**Weak**: "Sales increased considerably"
**Strong**: "Sales rose 23% year-on-year to £4.2m"

## Filler Words and Phrases

These add no meaning and should be deleted.

### Common Fillers

**Redundant Introductions**:
- It should be noted that → Delete
- It is important to realise that → Delete
- The fact of the matter is → Delete
- At this point in time → now
- In this day and age → today, now
- For all intents and purposes → Delete

**Redundant Intensifiers**:
- very unique → unique (unique cannot be qualified)
- completely finish → finish
- absolutely essential → essential
- totally destroy → destroy
- extremely critical → critical

**Empty Phrases**:
- in terms of → Delete or use "in"
- in the process of → Delete
- for the purpose of → to, for
- in the final analysis → Delete
- at the end of the day → ultimately, finally

**Tautologies** (saying the same thing twice):
- advance planning → planning
- past history → history
- future plans → plans
- end result → result
- final outcome → outcome
- collaborate together → collaborate
- join together → join

## Hedging vs Precision

### Excessive Hedging

**Weak**: "This could possibly lead to somewhat better outcomes in certain cases"
**Strong**: "This improves outcomes in 60% of cases"

**Weak**: "The policy may potentially have a relatively positive impact"
**Strong**: "The policy is expected to reduce costs by 15%"

### When to Be Specific

Replace vague time references:
- "recently" → last month, in Q3, on 15th October
- "soon" → next week, by March, within 30 days
- "in the near future" → by year-end, within six months

Replace vague locations:
- "in many countries" → in the UK, US and Germany
- "across the region" → in Southeast Asia (or name specific countries)

Replace vague sources:
- "according to reports" → according to the IMF's October report
- "data shows" → ONS data shows

## Numbers and Statistics

### Be Specific

**Vague**: "The unemployment rate is low"
**Precise**: "Unemployment stands at 4.2%, its lowest since 2019"

**Vague**: "Inflation has risen sharply"
**Precise**: "Inflation jumped from 2.1% to 4.7% in six months"

### Context Matters

- Always provide context for numbers (up from what? compared to what?)
- Use absolute numbers AND percentages when appropriate
- Round appropriately (don't say 23.47% when 23% is clearer)

### Date Precision

- Use specific dates: "1st January 2025" not "early 2025"
- Be clear about timeframes: "between March and June 2024" not "in spring"
- Use "last month" only in time-sensitive contexts; otherwise specify

## Attribution

Always attribute claims and viewpoints.

**Weak**: "It is believed interest rates will fall"
**Strong**: "The Bank of England expects to cut rates twice this year"

**Weak**: "Critics argue the policy will fail"
**Strong**: "Opposition MPs claim the policy will cost £2bn more than projected"

## Removing Redundancy

### Redundant Pairs

Delete one:
- each and every → each OR every
- first and foremost → first
- null and void → void
- various and sundry → various
- hopes and dreams → hopes
- aid and abet → aid

### Unnecessary Modifiers

- completely unanimous → unanimous
- circle around → circle
- close proximity → proximity
- general consensus → consensus
- unexpected surprise → surprise
- free gift → gift
