# Structure and Organisation Guidelines

Good structure is invisible. Readers should follow your argument effortlessly. Every paragraph should earn its place.

## Paragraph Structure

### The Topic Sentence
Each paragraph needs a clear topic sentence—usually the first. It tells readers what the paragraph is about.

**Strong topic sentences**:
- "Three factors explain the slowdown"
- "The policy has failed for a simple reason"
- "Critics make a valid point"

**Weak topic sentences**:
- "There are several things to consider" (vague)
- "It is interesting to note that" (empty)
- "Another thing is" (lacks substance)

### One Idea Per Paragraph
A paragraph should develop a single point. If you're making a new point, start a new paragraph.

**Signs a paragraph should be split**:
- It contains "however" or "on the other hand" mid-paragraph
- It exceeds 150 words
- It makes more than one main claim

### Paragraph Length
- Aim for 3–5 sentences
- Vary length for rhythm, but avoid extremes
- Single-sentence paragraphs can add emphasis—use sparingly
- Very long paragraphs lose readers

## Logical Flow and Transitions

### Build Arguments Logically

Order your paragraphs to lead readers through your argument:

1. **Chronological**: Events in time order
2. **Cause and effect**: Problem → causes → consequences
3. **General to specific**: Broad claim → supporting details
4. **Specific to general**: Evidence → broader conclusion
5. **Compare and contrast**: Option A → Option B → Assessment
6. **Order of importance**: Most significant point first (or last for emphasis)

### Transition Words

Use transitions to show relationships between ideas:

| Relationship | Transitions |
|--------------|-------------|
| Addition | Also, moreover, furthermore, in addition |
| Contrast | However, nevertheless, yet, by contrast, on the other hand |
| Cause | Because, since, as a result, therefore, consequently |
| Example | For instance, for example, such as |
| Sequence | First, second, finally, then, next |
| Conclusion | Thus, therefore, in short, ultimately |

### Transition Warnings

**Avoid overuse**: Too many transitions make prose feel mechanical.

**Avoid weak transitions**:
- "Another thing is..."
- "Moving on to..."
- "Speaking of which..."

**Show, don't signpost**: Often the logic is clear without explicit transitions. Trust your reader.

## Headlines and Titles

### Headline Principles
- Be specific, not generic
- Include the key information
- Use active voice when possible
- Avoid questions (usually)
- Keep under 10 words

### Strong vs Weak Headlines

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Economy news" | "Growth slows to 1% as exports fall" |
| "A look at taxes" | "Tax reform stalls in Congress" |
| "Interesting developments" | "China launches antitrust probe" |

### Headline Style
- Capitalise principal words (title case) or first word only (sentence case)—be consistent
- Omit full stops at the end
- Avoid abbreviations readers may not know
- No exclamation marks

## The Lead (Opening)

### Hook the Reader
The first sentence must earn the second. Start with something concrete, surprising, or significant.

**Strong leads**:
- Start with a striking fact: "China now consumes more cement than the rest of the world combined"
- Start with a person or scene: "When Maria Chen opened her factory in 2010..."
- Start with a question (sparingly): "Can democracy survive the internet?"
- Start with the news: "The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the tenth consecutive time"

**Weak leads**:
- Definitions: "Inflation is defined as..."
- History lessons: "Since ancient times, humans have..."
- Empty statements: "There are many factors to consider..."
- Clichés: "In today's fast-paced world..."

### The Nut Paragraph
After the lead, include a paragraph that summarises what the piece is about and why it matters. This is the "nut graf"—the nutshell summary.

**Elements of a good nut paragraph**:
- What is happening
- Why it matters
- What the piece will cover

## Body Structure

### The Inverted Pyramid
In news writing, put the most important information first:
1. Lead: The news
2. Nut graf: Context and significance
3. Details: Supporting information
4. Background: Additional context
5. Least essential: Can be cut if needed

### For Analysis and Features
Build an argument or narrative:
1. Hook: Engaging opening
2. Setup: Context and stakes
3. Development: Evidence, examples, analysis
4. Complications: Counterarguments, nuances
5. Resolution: Conclusion and implications

### Signposting Structure
For longer pieces, help readers navigate:
- Subheadings break up long text
- Numbered points for lists
- "First... Second... Third..." for sequential arguments
- Brief summaries of what's coming

## Conclusions

### End with Purpose
The conclusion should do more than stop. It should:
- Summarise the main point (briefly)
- Provide perspective or implications
- Leave readers with something to think about
- Look forward when appropriate

### Strong Closings

**Return to the opening**: Circle back to your lead for symmetry.
**A telling detail**: End with a specific image or quote.
**The bigger picture**: What does this mean for the future?
**A call to action**: What should be done? (When appropriate)

### Weak Closings

**Avoid**:
- "In conclusion..." (unnecessary signposting)
- Introducing new information
- Clichés: "Only time will tell"
- Trailing off without purpose
- Mere summary of everything already said

## Common Structural Problems

### Problem: Burying the Lead
The main point appears in paragraph three or four.

**Fix**: Move the key information up. Ask: "What's the most important thing?" Put that first.

### Problem: Repetition
The same point is made in multiple paragraphs.

**Fix**: Combine or cut. Each paragraph should add something new.

### Problem: Logical Gaps
The argument jumps from A to C without B.

**Fix**: Add the missing step, or acknowledge the leap explicitly.

### Problem: Anticlimactic Ending
The piece fizzles out with minor details.

**Fix**: Save something strong for the end. Cut trailing details.

### Problem: Too Many Subplots
The piece tries to cover too much.

**Fix**: Focus. What is this piece really about? Cut tangents or save them for another piece.

## Checklist

- [ ] Does every paragraph have a clear topic?
- [ ] Is the most important information near the top?
- [ ] Does the lead hook the reader?
- [ ] Is the structure logical and easy to follow?
- [ ] Do transitions connect ideas without being mechanical?
- [ ] Does the conclusion add value, not just summarise?
- [ ] Could any paragraph be cut without loss?
